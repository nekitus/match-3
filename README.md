### Setup ###

It's easy to get started with Pixi.js! Simply download a [prebuilt build](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/wiki/FAQs#where-can-i-get-a-build)!

Alternatively, Pixi.js can be installed with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) or simply using a content delivery network (CDN) URL to embed Pixi.js directly on your HTML page.

_Note: After v4.5.0, support for the [Bower](https://bower.io) package manager has been dropped. Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/releases/tag/v4.5.0) for more information._

#### NPM Install

```
$> npm install pixi.js
```
